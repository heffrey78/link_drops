## Key Technical Dependencies

1. **AP Movement System** - Foundation for terrain effects, equipment bonuses, and weather impacts
2. **Equipment Framework** - Required before implementing equipment effects on gameplay
3. **Card Data Structure** - Needed before battle implementation
4. **Meta-progression Storage** - Required before implementing permanent upgrades
5. **Weather System** - Depends on terrain system being complete
6. **Boss Framework** - Requires card battle system to be functional
7. **Puzzle System** - Relatively independent but benefits from meta-progression for rewards

## Resource Allocation & Team Structure

### Frontend Team (3-4 developers)
- UI/UX implementation
- Animation systems
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features

### Gameplay Team (3-4 developers)
- Core mechanics
- Battle system
- Weather effects
- Boss encounters

### Backend Team (2-3 developers)
- Data structures
- Progression systems
- Save/load functionality
- Performance optimization

### Art & Sound Team (2-3 specialists)
- Visual assets
- Animation frames
- Sound effects
- Music

## Technical Architectural Considerations

1. **Modularity** - Each system (terrain, equipment, cards, etc.) should be encapsulated with clear interfaces
2. **State Management** - Use a centralized game state with type-safe access patterns
3. **Event System** - Implement pub/sub for cross-system communication
4. **Performance Profiling** - Regular testing of render performance, especially for weather effects and battles
5. **Save Data Versioning** - Ensure forward compatibility for meta-progression

## Milestone Delivery Schedule

- **Alpha (Week 16)**: Core gameplay, terrain mechanics, equipment system
- **Beta (Week 32)**: Card battles, weather system, basic progression
- **Feature Complete (Week 52)**: All features implemented including bosses and puzzles
- **Release Candidate (Week 58)**: Fully tested and balanced
- **Gold Release (Week 60)**: Final version with all polish and optimizations

This roadmap provides a comprehensive path to transform Link Drops from its current state into a feature-rich game with deep strategic elements, meaningful progression, and varied gameplay experiences while maintaining the core Tetris-meets-adventure concept.
